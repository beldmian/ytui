# Youtube TUI client

This client works using mpv as player and [notyoutube](https://notyoutube.org/) as youtube mirror

# Usage

To use this you need to install [mpv](https://mpv.io/) and [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).

Then create `config.json` file like that:
```json
{
    "channels": ["UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw"]
}
```
You can pick id of channel from url on [notyoutube](https://notyoutube.org/) (looks like `https://notyoutube.org/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw`)
